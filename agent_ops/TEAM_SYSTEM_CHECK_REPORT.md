# Team System Check Report (A1-A8)

Check date: `2026-02-13`

System name (stakeholder-facing): `MarketMakeRL`

Objective: every team member validated their system step before analytics collaboration and stakeholder dashboard generation.

## Step Coverage and Ownership

1. `A1 Runtime Orchestrator`
- Step: runtime and orchestration reliability
- Evidence:
  - `make daily-smoke EXCHANGE=binance SYMBOL=BTC/USDT ITERATIONS=2 POLL_SECONDS=1` -> pass

2. `A2 Data and Signal Engineer`
- Step: market-data integrity and freshness
- Evidence:
  - `make data-freshness EXCHANGE=binance SYMBOL=BTC/USDT TIMEFRAME=1m` -> pass
- Verdict: `pass`

3. `A3 Modeling Engineer`
- Step: strategy exploration and regime behavior
- Evidence:
  - `make quant-experiments EXCHANGE=binance SYMBOL=BTC/USDT DAYS=30` -> pass
  - recommendation: `trend_shield` (budget 10k)
  - artifact: `artifacts/quant_experiments/20260213T053811Z_quant_experiments.json`
- Verdict: `pass`

4. `A4 Backtest and Risk Engineer`
- Step: risk gate robustness
- Evidence:
  - `make walk-forward EXCHANGE=binance SYMBOL=BTC/USDT DAYS=30` -> pass
  - artifact: `artifacts/walk_forward/20260213T053933Z_walk_forward_report.json`
- Verdict: `pass`

5. `A5 QA and Integration Engineer`
- Step: gate and incident process completeness
- Evidence:
  - `agent_ops/FAILURE_TRIAGE_TEMPLATE.md`
  - `agent_ops/WEEKLY_GATE_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md`
- Verdict: `pass`

6. `A6 Documentation Architect`
- Step: stakeholder-facing documentation coherence
- Evidence:
  - updated `README.md`, `docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md`, `docs/test_strategy.md`
  - docs index includes analytics artifacts and dashboard flow
- Verdict: `pass`

7. `A7 Quant Researcher`
- Step: weekly reliability and quantitative summary
- Evidence:
  - `make weekly-report` -> pass
  - artifact: latest under `artifacts/weekly/`
- Verdict: `pass`

8. `A8 Project Manager`
- Step: realization step-up and cross-team sync
- Evidence:
  - `make realization-step EXCHANGE=binance SYMBOL=BTC/USDT SYMBOLS=BTC/USDT,ETH/USDT` -> pass
  - multisymbol paper artifacts for BTC and ETH generated
- Verdict: `pass`

## Collaboration Output

All agents validated their system step and collaborated on analytics packaging.

Next deliverable:

- stakeholder dashboard generated by: `make stakeholder-dashboard`
- output: `artifacts/dashboard/latest_stakeholder_dashboard.html`

## Round 2 Robustness Upgrade Check

Objective: confirm robust metric upgrade and wider quant experiment matrix before market-entry prep review.

1. `A3/A4 Quant + Risk`
- Step: replace drawdown-only recommendation with robust metrics
- Evidence:
  - `scripts/quant_strategy_experiments.py` now reports `sortino_ratio`, `calmar_ratio`, `cvar_95_pct`, `ulcer_index`, `profit_factor`
  - recommendation uses robust composite score and stricter gates
- Verdict: `pass`

2. `A6 Documentation`
- Step: branding and docs consistency
- Evidence:
  - stakeholder dashboard branding updated to `MarketMakeRL`
  - docs updated with robust-metric policy and expanded quant command
- Verdict: `pass`

3. `A1/A5 Runtime + QA`
- Step: end-to-end revalidation in Docker
- Evidence:
  - `make test`, `make quant-experiments ...`, `make stakeholder-dashboard`, `make consistency-check`, `make publish-showcase`
- Verdict: `pass`

4. `A8 PM`
- Step: stakeholder narrative readiness
- Evidence:
  - dashboard cards now emphasize robust stats (Sortino, CVaR95, Robustness Score)
- Verdict: `pass`
