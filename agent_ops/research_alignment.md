# Deep Research Alignment

Source reviewed: `/Users/nody/codexpro/deep-research-report.md`

## Incorporated

1. Unified config-driven runtime.
2. Paper-first policy with hard live lock.
3. A1-A8 ownership model with shared workboard.
4. Gate-driven workflow through Make targets.
5. Drawdown failure threshold standardized at `40%` of budget.

## Open Assumptions

1. Live execution adapter remains intentionally disabled in MVP.
2. Additional risk controls (kill-switch and richer limits) should still be hardened before live keys.
3. Reliability is currently positive in latest cycle but must be revalidated weekly for drift.

## Active Sequence

1. A3/A4: improve regime adaptation and downside stability without weakening strict gates.
2. A7: publish weekly rolling 30-day report with go/no-go recommendation.
3. A5/A6: maintain regression and strict documentation governance alignment.
4. A8: run weekly release gate review and enforce rollback criteria.
