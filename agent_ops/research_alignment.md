# Deep Research Alignment

Source reviewed: `/Users/nody/codexpro/deep-research-report.md`

## Incorporated

1. Unified config-driven runtime.
2. Paper-first policy with hard live lock.
3. A1-A8 ownership model with shared workboard.
4. Gate-driven workflow through Make targets.
5. Drawdown failure threshold standardized at `40%` of budget.

## Open Assumptions

1. Live execution adapter remains intentionally disabled in MVP.
2. Additional risk controls (kill-switch and richer limits) are still being hardened.
3. Strategy economics are not yet consistently positive under current market regimes.

## Active Sequence

1. A3/A4: continue execution + risk + fee-aware improvements.
2. A7: rerun quant gate until consistent pass on risk criteria.
3. A5/A6: maintain regression and documentation alignment.
4. A8: keep release gating and stakeholder tracking current.
